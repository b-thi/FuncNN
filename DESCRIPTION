Description: A collection of functions which fits models of the form y(z, f(x) | theta) = z + f(x) + epsilon. In other words, this package will allow users to build
             models that have either functional or scalar responses paired with functional and scalar covariates. We implement the theoretical discussion 
             found in (Thind, Multani and Cao, 2020), applying the framework of fitting neural networks to functional data analysis with a number of helper 
             functions that make workflow easier for the user.
